#### Does Battlesnake require machine learning / artificial intelligence?

You can build your snake using any technology you want!

#### What cloud provider and region is play.battlesnake.com hosted in?

The current game engine is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, in the `US-WEST1` (Oregon) region. It's possible, but unlikely this could change in the future. It's more likely that we'll expand the engine to include multiple and configurable regions.
