## A Few Tips for Writing Documentation
Our documentation lives [here in our docs repository](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/docs) as markdown files. We are always learning how to write better documentation for everyone, here are some tips we found useful for writing docs to get you started.


#### Informative and friendly
Feel free to write in a casual tone, we're all humans(except for the snake bots we build). Just don't forget: Being informative by presenting information in a clear and thoughtful manner is the most friendly act of all.

#### Avoid "easy", "simple", or "just..."
Whether something is easy depends on how much experience you have with the subject and we want our documentation be as inclusive as possible.

#### Use Descriptive Headers and Sub-headers
Some people read every word, but others just want to scan for the information they need. Descriptive headers help anyone scanning the document by grouping information. Organizing your thoughts by starting with an outline of descriptive headers can also be a great way to start writing!

#### Add Images
Images are great for breaking up a wall of text, which helps make information easier to absorb. Images are also apparently worth 1000 words, so a good image can convey or reinforce what your documentation needs to get across to the reader.
